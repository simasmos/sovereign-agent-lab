Exercise 3 — Answers
====================
Fill this in after completing the three Rasa conversations.

CALM vs Old Rasa — what changed
---------------------------------
The old open-source Rasa approach used:
  - nlu.yml: intent training examples
  - rules.yml: explicit dialogue rules
  - FormValidationAction: Python class to parse slot values

Rasa Pro CALM uses:
  - flows.yml: natural language descriptions of what each flow does
  - from_llm slots: the LLM extracts values from conversation
  - ONE custom action: ActionValidateBooking for the business rules

The conversation is the same from the manager's perspective.
The machinery underneath is completely different.

CONVERSATION SCRIPTS
---------------------
Conversation 1 (happy path):
  You:    calling to confirm a booking
  Agent:  [asks guest count]
  You:    160 guests
  Agent:  [asks vegan count]
  You:    about 50 need vegan
  Agent:  [asks deposit]
  You:    £200 deposit
  Agent:  [confirms or escalates?]

Conversation 2 (deposit too high):
  Same as above but use a deposit above £300 (e.g. "£500 deposit").

Conversation 3 (out of scope):
  Start normally, then when asked for vegan count say something like
  "can you arrange parking for the speakers?" and observe what happens.
  Does CALM handle this differently than the old rules approach?

CONVERSATION_3_WHAT_HAPPENED = """
The agent apologised and said it was not trained to help with that. 
It reiterated that it could only assist with venue booking confirmations. 
It did not attempt to transfer me or suggest an alternative contact method.
Then it asked if I would like to continue with the booking.

OUT_OF_SCOPE_COMPARISON = """
LangGraph correctly identified that the requst was out of scope and then used
what LLM could come up with to answer the question. It shared web sites with
time tables for the trains and provided a phone number of the transport agency.
We don't have such information in our project, so depending on the model it
can be outdated or hallucinated.

Rasa CALM responds with a specific utter_out_of_scope message and asks if
I would like to continue with the booking. It does not attempt to answer
the question. It is more strict, predictable, but also rigid answer.

Retrained the model and ran the default conversation script.
Instead of validating the booking, the agent escalated:

confirmation before the 5 PM deadline. Can I call you back within 15 minutes?'
"""

# ── CALM vs Old Rasa ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# In the old open-source Rasa (3.6.x), you needed:
#   ValidateBookingConfirmationForm with regex to parse "about 160" → 160.0
#   nlu.yml intent examples to classify "I'm calling to confirm"
#   rules.yml to define every dialogue path
#
# In Rasa Pro CALM, you need:
#   flow descriptions so the LLM knows when to trigger confirm_booking
#   from_llm slot mappings so the LLM extracts values from natural speech
#   ONE action class (ActionValidateBooking) for the business rules
#
# What does this simplification cost? What does it gain?
# Min 30 words.

CALM_VS_OLD_RASA = """
The LLM now handles slot extraction via from_llm mappings in domain.yml.
This allows to avoid implementing values parsing and training samples
and provides greater flexibility by using LLM to extract values from
natural speech. But also can lead to hallucinations and misinterpretation.

The business logic is still handled by Python code in actions.py.
So, for example the deposit amount would be strictly compared with
the limit in Python code. 
"""

# ── The setup cost ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# CALM still required: config.yml, domain.yml, flows.yml, endpoints.yml,
# rasa train, two terminals, and a Rasa Pro licence.
# The old Rasa ALSO needed nlu.yml, rules.yml, and a FormValidationAction.
#
# CALM is simpler. But it's still significantly more setup than LangGraph.
# That setup bought you something specific.
# Min 40 words.

SETUP_COST_VALUE = """
Setting up Rasa CALM is more complex comparing to LangGraph, but it provides
more predictability and better control over the conversation.
It won't come up with the telephone number of the transportation agency and
will stick to the specific task it was designed for: to confirm the booking.
In scenarios with strict constraints, like deposit amount, its more reliable.
